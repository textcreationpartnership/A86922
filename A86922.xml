            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by the <hi>Engli≈øh prote≈øtants,</hi> In≈øomuch that it hath di≈ømaied our men, and made them revolt from us, becau≈øe that we had a repul≈øe from <hi>Dublin,</hi> after we had got into the Town, by the help of ≈øome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks that lived in the Town, which brake down an old door in the Town wall, and ≈øo we got in, and were advanced in the ≈øtreets before the alarum was given, but we were ≈øoon di≈øcovered, and lo≈øt 600, of our men in the fight, where wee thought to have had the be≈øt of it, wee had the wor≈øt: but the next day being re≈øolved to recover our ≈øelves again, ≈øeeing an Engli≈øh ≈øhip ≈øtrike on the ground in the harbor neer unto us, ≈øo that we fell upon her, accounting her our own; becau≈øe we thought that ≈øhee was not able to help her ≈øelf with her ordinance, but onely with a few muskets, the which our men ≈øeeing of it, they ≈øhot at them ≈øomwhat thick, and afterwards waded into the water to her, being not deep to board her, and appri≈øe her, and to take the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But the Captain of the ≈øhip being ≈øomewhat ≈øtout-hearted, and weighed not what our men did at him, till he ≈øaw his own time; but after he had got ≈øo many together as he thought good of, and our men looking when he would yeeld to them, ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly he finding no wayes to relieve him, and cleer him≈øelf of us, he threw out Granadoes of fire upon us, and killed a hundred of our men, and ≈øeeing that we had lo≈øt ≈øo many men, we were forced to leave the ≈øhip with the lo≈ø≈øe of them, and venter no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that day.</p>

            <p>Good Madam, I pray have me commended to my Father <hi>Jack≈øon,</hi> and tell him that I would not have him come over as yet, although we have a want of him and ≈øome others, untill he doth hear from me again with better newes, and that ≈øhall be as ≈øoon as po≈øsible I can with all convenience, for all the Prie≈øts and Friers that are taken here by the Engli≈øh, they are wor≈øe u≈øed here then there, for the Engli≈øh officers have taken fiftie Friers and Prie≈øts, and hanged them all in one day, O horrid and bloody ≈øight to ≈øee ≈øo many good and holy men cut off in one day without mercie, or any time of repentance, the which did make us to be amazed to ≈øee it, and could not in no wayes help them.
